// Write the code that will log true or false for the following:

// Is 34 divided by 3 greater than 67 divided by 2?

    console.log((34/3) > (67/2))

// Does 5 evaluate to the same as "5"?

    console.log(5 == "5")

// Does 5 strictly equal "5"?

    console.log(5 === "5")

// Does !3 strictly equal 3?

    console.log(!3 == 3)

// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 AND "Student".length strictly equal 7?

    console.log("LEARN".length === 5 && "Student".length === 7)

// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 OR "Student".length strictly equal 10?

    console.log("LEARN".length === 5 || "Student".length === 10)
    
// Does "LEARN" contain the subset "RN"?

    console.log("LEARN".includes("RN"))

// Does "LEARN" contain the subset "rn"?

    console.log("LEARN".includes("rn"))

// Does "LEARN"[0] strictly equal "l"?

    console.log("LEARN"[0] === "l")

// Modify the code from the previous question to return true.

    console.log("LEARN"[0] === "L")
