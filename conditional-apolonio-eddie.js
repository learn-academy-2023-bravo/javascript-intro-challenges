// Write the code that will log true or false for the following:
// Is 34 divided by 3 greater than 67 divided by 2?
// Does 5 evaluate to the same as "5"?
// Does 5 strictly equal "5"?
// Does !3 strictly equal 3?
// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 AND "Student".length strictly equal 7?
// Does "LEARN".length strictly equal 5 OR "Student".length strictly equal 10?
// Does "LEARN" contain the subset "RN"?
// Does "LEARN" contain the subset "rn"?
// Does "LEARN"[0] strictly equal "l"?
// Modify the code from the previous question to return true.

console.log(34/3 > 67/2)
console.log(5 === "5")
console.log(!3 === 3)
console.log("LEARN".length === 5 || "Student".length === 10)
console.log("LEARN".includes("RN"))
